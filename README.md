WORK IN PROGRESS

The suq-controller connects the modules "Uncertainty Quantification" and "Surrogate Model" (see other vadere/ Repos). 
The main functionality of the suq-controller is to query multiple (differently parametrized) Vadere scenarios and return the results of a quantity of interest (QoI) in a convenient format.
